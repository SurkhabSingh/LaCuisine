      instructions:
        'Preheat oven to 375 degrees.\nZucchini:  Cut stem tips of zucchinis off and discard. Slice lengthwise into two pieces. Take a teaspoon and hollow out each half... scraping away seeds and core until smooth. Be sure to leave about 1/4 inch of flesh or the flute will be too weak. Set on baking tray.\nMousse:  Put the ricotta, basil, garlic, and half of the shredded Parmesan cheese into a food processor and blend until creamy. If too thick... add just a dab of olive oil. But not too much as you need the mousse to stand firm in the zucchini flutes.\nOnce you reach the desired consistency - scoop the mousse out of processor into a zip lock baggie or pastry bag. If using a baggie, snip off about 1/4" of the corner and squeeze baggie to pipe out mousse into the hollowed section of the zucchini. Stop short of the end by about 1/2", as the ricotta will expand when baking. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan cheese along the top of flutes.\nPut tray of mousse-filled flutes on middle rack of oven, baking for 20 minutes at 375 degrees. Remove when zucchini is tender to a fork and the cheese has browned slightly. Once flutes are removed from the oven, sprinkle a few ricotta crumbles across the top and lightly drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Serve immediately.',

      instructions:
        "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. On a baking sheet place the squash halves, spray with PAM and sprinkle with 1-2 tbsp garam masala. Place in the oven and BROIL till tender and charred- about 10-15 minutes.\nWhile the squashes are roasting, in a large skillet, spray with PAM and add vegetable oil and set over medium heat. Add the cashews and saute until fragrant and slightly darkened. Add onions and peppers, sprinkle with black pepper and saute until soft, about 5-7 minutes. Once the onions and peppers are soft, but now brown, add the soaked basmati rice (make sure not to get any water in it!). Saute for 5-7 minutes. You want to toast the the rice.\nRemove the squash from the oven and cool for a few minutes before handling. Score the squash into small cubes, WITHOUT cutting through the skin. Scoop the cubes out into a bowl and set aside. Keep the shell aside, DONT throw out!\nOnce the rice is toasted add 1 cup of water, pinch of saffron, cover and cook on medium-low heat, about 15 minutes. You want the rice to be cooked thru, not mushy so dont mix it around too much! Once the rice is cooked, add the cubed squash, tossing gently (you dont want the squash to break and mush around the rice). Add the Biryani paste and toss to coat. Mix in 3/4 of the chopped cilantro. Taste for salt and biryani flavor- it should be strong, spicy and aromatic.\nIn a small skillet, spray with PAM and set over medium-high heat. Add onion slices, and saute without breaking up the circles. Cook until brown-ish about 4-5 minutes. Set aside.\nFill each squash bowl with rice, just coming over the top. Top each one with an onion round and sprinkle with remaining chopped cilantro. Serve with yogurt or raita.\nBiryani paste:\nIn a medium skillet, spray with pam, add oil and set over medium-high flame. Add onions and tomatoes, saute until golden-brown about 4-5 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, chili powder and cilantro. Saute until vegetables are soft and fragrant about 4-5 minutes. Add the biryani paste and mix well, making sure all the veggies are coated. Remove from the heat and let cool (10-15 minutes).\nIn a grinder/food processor, add the biryani mixture and grind until smooth (slightly chunky is ok). Store in an air tight container. Can be kept in the fridge for 1-2 weeks, or in the freezer- for a while!",

The chocolate may hold its shape when you remove it from the microwave, but it will be soft, so stir to melt it. If pieces remain after you have stirred it for a while then return to microwave for another few seconds and then stir again until it is fully melted. Be careful not to overheat the chocolate. You are better off starting with less time and reheating than overheating and ruining it.</li><li>When chocolate has melted add the sugar and vanilla and stir with a whisk to combine. Let it cool a little and then add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each addition. Don't add the eggs when the chocolate is hot because it may cook the whites.</li><li>Once the eggs are mixed in, place the flour in a strainer and sift over the chocolate mixture, a little at a time, mixing it in as you sift it over.

        "Combine all ingredients, from paprika down, in a small dish and stir thoroughly to combine.\nUsing a meat mallet, pound the chicken breasts pretty thin  about 1/2 inch thick.  Generously rub the spice mixture on all sides of chicken breasts, cover and let it sit in the refrigerator for about an hour.\nCombine all tabbouleh ingredients and adjust salt and oil to your preference.  Cover and chill while the chicken is marinating  but first you should do like I did and dip a handful of pita chips in it.\nWhen the chicken has marinated, prepare grill to medium heat.  Grill the chicken until done  at least 165.  I like mine very done, even with some crispy edges.\nHalf the pita bread, and split open.  Fill the halves with chicken, tabbouleh and finally the yogurt sauce.",

        "Instructions\n\n\n\nTo get started with this dish you will want to get two post of water boiling and cook your chicken breasts in one and your sausage in the other. I usually boil my chicken breasts for 15-20 minutes until the juices run clear when cut into, then cube them. For the sausage, slice it into bite sized pieces and boil for 10 minutes. Set aside after cooking to use later with the gumbo.\n\n\nThe roux is the most important part of a gumbo. If you don't get the roux right, you are probably not going to like your gumbo. There are many recipes you can try for a roux, but this is probably going to be one of the best you have ever had if you are a true gumbo fan. Let's get start making the gumbo.\n\n\nOver medium heat in a large pot, add your olive oil. Allow to warm for a minute, and then add in the flour. Stir constantly until all of the flour has disolved and the mixture has a lot of tiny bubbles. Once you have reached that consistency it's time to add in your garlic powder. Allow to bubble, constantly stirring for one minute.\n\n\nGradually stir in the chicken broth and the beer, stirring constantly until the mixture comes to a slow simmer. Add the celery, all tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, parsley, and cajun seasoning. Reduce heat to a slow simmer, cover, and continue to simmer for 40 minutes, stirring often.\n\n\nMix the chicken and sausage into the roux mixture, cover, and cook for an additional 20 minutes, stirring often. Add in the fil powder, stir well. \n\n\nOnce finished, serve over rice and with a side of french bread. So delicious!",

        "<ol><li>Preheat the oven to 375.</li><li>In a bowl, add the blackberries and the sugar together.  Let the berries macerate or if you are like me, you wait until it's halfway done. lol I couldn't wait any longer.</li><li>In a larger bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, salt and milk. Now add the melted butter and mix until it's well blended.</li><li>Now pour the batter into a ungreased baking dish (next time I'll be greasing it). Now spoon the berries on top of the batter.</li><li>Bake in the oven for 45-55 minutes. Serve warm with whip cream or some ice cream.  This lasted for about 15 minutes in my house. Yes, it was yummy.

        "<ol><li>Instructions</li><li>To Make Salsa: In a medium bowl, combine watermelon, cucumber, sweet pepper, corn, cilantro and onion. In a small bowl, mix together  cup lime juice, honey, red pepper flakes and salt. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving, to blend flavors.</li><li>To Make Chicken: In a shallow bowl add the chicken, 3 tablespoons lime juice and sprinkle with a little garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  Coat a large nonstick pan or a grill pan with olive oil spray, add olive oil and heat.  Add chicken, cover, and saut over medium heat until browned on both sides and cooked through, about 10-12 minutes total.  Remove the chicken from the pan</li><li>To Make Honey Lime Glaze: In a small bowl, mix together  cup lime juice, 2 tablespoons honey and Tabasco.  Add the honey lime glaze to the same pan.  Cook for about 30 seconds until melted.  Return cooked chicken to pan, flipping the chicken once to coat with the glaze.</li><li>Remove from pan and plate each piece.  Spoon watermelon salsa on top of each piece of chicken and serve with more salsa on the side.</li><li>Serve with our recipe for Simple Garlic Toast, if desired.  Recipe follows.</li><li>Recipe for Simple Garlic Toast</li><li>Start with 4 slices sourdough wheat bread. We bought ours at Trader Joes but most markets sell sourdough wheat bread or use regular sourdough slices.  Cut each slice in half and toast all of them.  Spread each half with 1 teaspoon reduced-fat butter or Smart Balance Light.  Sprinkle each with a little garlic powder. Place all 8 halves on a plate and reheat in microwave for about 15 seconds.</li><li>Our favorite garlic powder is Lawrys with parsley. Weve been buying it for years because it taste much better than most garlic powders.</li></ol>",

Pulse 3 times\nAdd butter; pulse 5 times until mixture resembles coarse meal. Be very careful - Don't over beat.\nAdd 1 tsp vanilla and sour cream; pulse 3 times or just until combined ( DO NOT over-mix). If you're afraid you might over-mix, you can transfer the mixture into a big bowl and add sour cream and vanilla. Use spatula to mix. If you over-mix, the mixture will be too runny.\nAdd cranberries, and nuts. Use spatula to mix well.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead lightly 3 times. Roll dough to a 1/2 inch thickness; cut with a 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter\nPlace cut dough on a baking sheet. Use a watermelon scoop or small round spoon to press in a middle of each cut though to make a half hole for raspberry jam\nMix together jam and the remaining vanilla extract.\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of jam into a hole. Don't over put it otherwise it will run all over a scone.\nBake for 14 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from baking sheet; transfer to a wire rack\nWhile they're cooling, combine powdered sugar and milk. Stir with a whisk until smooth. Drizzle the glaze evenly over scones.",

Sauté the shallots until they begin to lightly caramelize. Stir in the mushrooms, as well as some salt and pepper, and sauté until the mushrooms release their juices and turn golden brown.</li><li>Place a teaspoon of ghee in a pie plate or casserole dish; heat in the oven for about two minutes, or until the ghee is softened. Using a pastry brush, spread the melted ghee all around the inside of the baking dish. Add the mushroom and shallot mixture, then top with the crumbled goat cheese.</li><li>Using the back of a spoon, make four indentations in the mushroom mixture. Carefully crack an egg into each indentation. Top with salt, pepper, and herbes de Provence.</li><li>Bake for 18 to 23 minutes or until desired doneness. The whites should be cooked through but the yolks still soft. While the eggs are baking, toast the bread. Gently rub the toast with the cut side of the garlic clove until the bread is fragrant.</li><li>Remove the eggs from the oven. Top with fresh herbs or greens (I used baby arugula, but chopped chives would be fabulous, too) and serve with toast.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "Combine the rum and raisins in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil. Simmer for 30 seconds, then remove from heat. Cover and allow the raisins to macerate for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight.\nWhen youre ready to bake the bread, preheat the oven to 375F.\nCoat a baking sheet with olive oil and lightly dust it with flour, or line it with parchment paper.\nIn a large mixing bowl whisk together the flours, baking soda, salt, and rosemary. Stir in the toasted pecans.\nIn a separate bowl combine the raisins with the rum, the yogurt, and honey.\nAdd the wet ingredients to the dry. Mix until the dough is too stiff to stir. Use your hands to bring it together in the bowl. Add additional yogurt one teaspoon at a time if its too dry. You want a stiff, slightly tacky ball.\nTurn dough onto a lightly floured board and shape into a round loaf. (Dont over-knead the dough. Too much kneading will produce a tough bread.).\nTransfer the loaf to the prepared baking sheet. Use a sharp knife to make deep slashes across the top of the loaf, 4-6 cuts about half way through. Brush the top with milk. Sprinkle with seeds or oats if using.\nBake for 40-45 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. When you tap the loaf, it will sound hollow.\nCool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature with a generous slather of butter.",

        "Preheat oven to 425 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.\nDrain and rinse the chickpeas.\nPlace the chickpeas between two sheets of paper towels and rub them gently to absorb the excess water. Pick out any loosened skin from the chickpeas. Dont worry if you cant get all of them out.\nPour the dried chickpeas into a small bowl and mix in the olive oil, maple syrup, and cinnamon until well incorporated.\nPlace the chickpeas on the baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes.\nAfter 15 minutes, give the chickpeas a quick stir. Continue baking the chickpeas at 3-4 minute increments. When they are browned and look quite dried, take them out of the oven. The longer you leave them in the oven, the crunchier they will be, but be careful not to burn the chickpeas!\nLet them cool for a few minutes and sprinkle the sugar on the roasted chickpeas. Enjoy!",

        "<ol><li>For the Chicken Tacos:</li><li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li><li>Coat chicken with evoo and spices evenly on both sides, (save lime for cooked chicken.) Bake at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until cooked through and juices run clear. Let cool a bit. Decrease oven temperature to 200 degrees. While chicken is cooking make the guacamole and corn salsa.</li><li>While chicken is still warm, shred with 2 forks and when shredded, squeeze lime juice over the chicken and a bit of extra salt if needed. Keep chicken warm by covering it with foil.</li><li>In a skillet on med high heat, put a small amount of canola oil or cooking spray in the pan and let heat. Cook corn tortillas until browned on both sides and place on a cookie sheet in the 200 degree oven to keep warm while finishing the rest.</li><li>Make the tacos by laying a tortilla flat and adding chicken, corn salsa, and guacamole. Top with sour cream, salsa, shredded cabbage and a lime for garnish. Enjoy!</li><li>For the Corn Salsa:</li><li>Add all ingredients to a bowl and mix well. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep in the frig while cooking everything else so the ingredients can meld together.</li><li>For the Guacamole:</li><li>Add all ingredients to a bowl and mix well. Coating the avocado in the lime juice will help the guacamole to stay green and not turn brown. By chopping the avocado instead of creaming it it will make the guacamole stay green for days! I like to cut the tomato and avocado about the same size but all the other ingredients I finely chop.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.In a medium bowl, combine the peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla and 2 tablespoons of the coconut flour until well blended. Add additional coconut flour if the peanut mixture is too soft  it should be pliable and easy to form into shapes with your hands.Using a tablespoon or ice cream scoop, drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Form into balls and flatten each ball slightly with your fingers. Place in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes until firm.Melt the chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring often, until melted. Let cool for a few minutes and then dip each of the frozen peanut butter pieces into the chocolate to coat completely. Using a fork is a good way to do this and be sure to work quickly.Transfer each peanut butter cup back to the baking sheet and return to the freezer. Sprinkle with a little coarse sea salt if desired. Chill until set, about 1 hour or more. These will keep well in the freezer for several days, if they last that long.Note: You can make a half batch instead, but these are so good, you won't want to do that, especially as they keep so well.",

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Begin by preheating oven to 160C for standard heating oven, 150C for fan-forced oven. I cant stress enough how important it is to have an efficient oven when it comes to baking. So if you intend to bake regularly, please invest in an oven thermometer so that you know the exact temperature your oven heats up to.</li><li>Next, grease and line a 10 X 10 X 3 square baking pan or 11 round pan. Grease first, line with baking paper and then grease again.</li><li>Add 5 large eggs to a large deep mixing bowl.</li><li>Add 1 cup of sugar. Feel free to cut this amount by a tablespoon or two if your bananas are very very ripe. Ripe bananas have alot of sugar in them.</li><li>Add 1 teaspoon of banana flavoured essence.</li><li>Peel about 5 large bananas to get 400g of bananas. Use very ripe bananas. The stronger they smell, the better. You can cut the bananas into large pieces if they are too long for the bowl.</li><li>Add the bananas to the egg and sugar mixture. Beat at low speed for one minute and then at maximum speed for 14 minutes.</li><li>Let the machine whisk the mixture until it resembles whipped cream. If the mixture is still runny or wet, whisk some more. It should be white, stiff and non-dripping.</li><li>While the egg and banana mixture is being whisked, prepare the dry ingredients.</li><li>Sieve 2 & 1/2 cups of plain flour into a bowl. Add 1 & 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. Add 1/2 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda.</li><li>Prepare 200g of vegetable oil  about 2/3 cup and 1/4 cup.</li><li>Transfer the whisked egg-banana mixture to a large bowl/pot if necessary.</li><li>Add the flour mixture in 3 parts to the egg-banana mixture. Fold the flour mixture into the egg-banana mixture with your hands. Use large folding movements. Do this step in 3 parts. Dont add all the flour at one time.</li><li>When the flour mixture has been folded into the egg-banana mixture, add the vegetable oil. And fold that in as well. If you have chopped walnuts, add them here too.

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>To make the frosting:</li><li>In a medium-size pan, heat the cream and sugar. Stir until the sugar has dissolved.</li><li>Add the chocolate  & espresso powder and stir until it is thoroughly melted. Remove from the heat, cover, and let cool for about 10 minutes or at least to room temperature.</li><li>Using a mixer, mix the butter on medium-high speed until it is smooth and creamy.</li><li>Turn the mixer to medium-low and add half of the chocolate mixture along with the vanilla. Mix well. Add the remaining chocolate mixture and mix until smooth and creamy. Set aside until it hardens slightly, to become a spreadable consistency, 1 to 2 hours. (Or, you can refrigerate the frosting for about 30 minutes, or until it becomes thickened and spreadable. Bring it to room temperature before frosting.)</li><li>To make the cake:</li><li>Preheat the oven to 350*</li><li>Generously grease three 9-inch round cake pans. Cut a piece of waxed paper to fit the bottom of each pan and place inside the pans. Grease the waxed paper, and dust the pans with cocoa powder until well coated. Set aside.</li><li>In a small heatproof bowl, pour the boiling water over the 1/2 cup cocoa. Stir until the mixture is very smooth, and set aside to cool.</li><li>Melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Stir occasionally until smooth. Remove from the heat.</li><li>Into a medium-size bowl, sift together both flours, the baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li><li>In a bowl, beat the butter until smooth and creamy, (about 5 minutes). Add 2 1/4 cups of the sugar and beat until well blended, (about 5 minutes). Beat in the whole egg and egg yolks, one at a time. Beat in the cooled cocoa mixture until very smooth, scraping down the sides as you go. Turn the mixer to medium-low and add the melted chocolate, beating until well incorporated. Add the vanilla.</li><li>Turn the mixer to low and add half the dry ingredients. Then add the quark, mix well, and add the rest of the dry ingredients. Beat until smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li><li>In a bowl, using clean beaters, beat the egg whites at high speed. When frothy, add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until the egg whites form stiff peaks, 5 to 6 minutes.</li><li>Using a large rubber spatula, fold about 1 cup of the chocolate mixture into the egg whites. Then gently fold that mixture back into the chocolate mixture, just until the egg whites are well incorporated. Do not overmix.</li><li>Distribute the batter evenly among the pans, and bake in the center of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Do not overbake.</li><li>Cakes are done when the tops are just beginning to crack and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs clinging to it. Let cool on a rack for about 15 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and let cool completely on a wire rack.</li><li>To assemble:</li><li>Place the first layer on a serving plate and frost the top only. Place the second layer on top of the first and frost the top. Repeat with the top layer. Spread the remaining frosting along the sides until the cake is completely covered with frosting.</li></ol>",

Beat until smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes.In a bowl, using clean beaters, beat the egg whites at high speed. When frothy, add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until the egg whites form stiff peaks, 5 to 6 minutes.Using a large rubber spatula, fold about 1 cup of the chocolate mixture into the egg whites. Then gently fold that mixture back into the chocolate mixture, just until the egg whites are well incorporated. Do not overmix.Distribute the batter evenly among the pans, and bake in the center of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Do not overbake.Cakes are done when the tops are just beginning to crack and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs clinging to it.",

      instructions:
        "Begin by preparing the pancake batter. Whisk together the rice flour, egg, sea salt, turmeric, cayenne and green chili. Gradually whisk in the coconut milk. The mixture should be a smooth, semi-thick batter that is of pouring consistency. Add a little water if necessary. Cover and set aside while you prepare the rest of the food.Now prepare the sauce. Whisk together all of the ingredients and set aside.For the filling, combine the carrot, radish, green onions, green chilies and snow peas. Put the herbs in another bowl and have your sprouts ready along with the mushrooms.Heat a teaspoon of oil over medium heat in a non-stick skillet. When hot, ladle 1/2 cup of batter into the pan and spread with the bottom of the ladle until you have a roughly 6 to 8 inch pancake.  Fry for 6 to 8 minutes or until you have small holes forming and the bottom is crispy brown, then flip and fry for another few minutes on the other side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm in a 150 oven while you finish the rest of the pancakes  you should finish with 4 to 6 pancakes.To serve, scatter a portion of the vegetables, herbs and mushrooms over one half of the pancake. Sprinkle some sauce over top and fold the pancake. Drizzle with more sauce and there you go.",

      instructions:
        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.Combine strawberries, nutella, cornstarch, sugar, and vanilla in a mixing bowl until strawberries are evenly coated.Pour mixture into a 9 inch round pie pan.In another mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.Slowly add the cream and whisk until just combined.Roll out the mixture onto a non stick baking mat and knead one or two times to combine.Grab a handful of dough (approx 3 tbsp.) and roll into a ball and then gently flatten.Lay biscuits over the strawberry mixture, having them slightly overlap. These do not have to be perfect.Spread a small amount of left over cream over the biscuits and then sprinkle with a small amount of sugar.Bake for 20-25 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown and the strawberries are bubbling.Let cool for at least half an hour so that the strawberry juices can firm back up.Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream!",

      instructions:
        "To prepare the pork filling -\nMince 700g of pork and place them in a large mixing bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of corn starch, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of ground white pepper,  1/2 teaspoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of Maggie Seasoning Sauce or Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons of Shaoxing Huatiao wine and 2 tablespoons of sesame oil.\nRoughly chop 80g of water chestnuts into fine pieces. I used canned ones.\nChop 4 large Chinese mushrooms into fine pieces too.\nAdd the water chestnuts and mushrooms to the pork mixture. Mix all the ingredients well to combine.\nFinely dice a small carrot. These will be placed on top each pork siew mai to garnish. Use salmon roe or salted egg yolk if preferred.\nSet aside the pork mixture and the diced carrots till ready to wrap dumplings.\n\nTo make the glutinous rice filling -\nSoak 2 lap cheongs (Chinese sausages) in boiling water until the skin is separated from the meat. Remove the skin from the lap cheong and cut them into small dices.\nIn a large sauce pan over medium-high heat, pan fry the lap cheong dices until they are golden but not brown. They should be a lovely red.\nFollow the instructions at Glutinous Rice in Lotus Leaf (http://cooking.storyofbing.com/2010/07/glutinous-rice-in-lotus-leaf-2/) and prepare the glutinous rice. Once the rice and other ingredients are stir fried till fragrant, add the pieces of fried lap cheong and set aside to cool.\n\nPrepare the ingredients necessary for the wrapping of the dumplings.\nStart by placing a sheet of wonton wrapper on a flat surface. Place a small teaspoon of filling in the centre of the wonton wrapper.\nDap finger in some water and gently wet the sides of the wonton wrapper.\nGather the wonton wrapper with the filling in the palm of hand and squeeze gently while folding the wrapper skin upwards and against the filling so that the wonton wrapper wraps the filling tightly.\nMake sure the dumplings are tight. Otherwise they may fall apart while being steamed. Use more water to seal them if necessary.\nPlace a large shrimp on the top of each pork siew mai.\nAdd a few pieces of chopped carrot or salmon roe or salted egg yolk to add a fresh colour to the dumpling.\nDo the same for the glutinous rice siew mai, adding more lap cheong pieces on the top if preferred.\nPlace the dumplings in a steamer lined with baking paper. Cut some holes through the baking paper to let the steam through.\nPlace the steamer over boiling water for 14-15 minutes or until the filling is cooked.\nServe hot.\nUncooked dumplings may be frozen and steamed at a later date. Dust some flour in a container so that the dumplings wont stick to it.",

        "<ol><li>Soak cedar plank in water for 2 hours.  Rinse salmon under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Place a medium sauce pan over medium high heat and add bourbon or brandy.  Use caution as the alcohol can ignite; never pour directly from the bottle.   When alcohol is reduced and there is only a small amount left, add apple juice, brown sugar, and garlic.  Continue to cook over medium high heat until reduced to about  of the original volume (should be slightly thinner than syrup).</li><li>Season salmon with salt and pepper on both sides, brush skin side with olive oil and place on cedar plank, skin side down.  Place cedar plank on a medium high grill, or in a wood fired oven pre-heated to 500F near the fire.  Use a probe thermometer to check the internal temperature of the salmon after 10 minutes, and every 5 minutes or so thereafter.  Once the salmon has an internal temperature of at least 100F, brush on the apple glaze that you made earlier, repeat this step every few minutes. Cook salmon until</li></ol>",

Take off the fire, add the thyme and salt and pepper to taste.\nBeat the eggs in a large bowl with the cream and half the quantity of cheese. Add the onion-mushroom mixture and mix well.\nPlace the pie shell on a cookie tray to catch any spillage. Pour the filling into the pie shell. Top the quiche with the remaining cheese.\nDrop the temperature to 375F and cook until the filling is set and golden. Serve when still warm from the oven.",

        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.\nGrease an 11x7 inch baking pan. If you don't have one, you can use an 8x8, 9x9, or if neceessary an 11x13.\nPlace peanut butter and butter in a microwave safe dish. Heat in the microwave for 30-45 seconds or until butter is melted. Stir together.\nPlace all ingredients, except fruit, into a bowl. Using an electric beater or KitchenAid mixer, beat ingredients together for approximately 1 minutes.\nPeel a whole apple and thinly chop into pinky nail size pieces.\nStir the apples into the oatmeal mixture.\nPour the mixture into greased pan and press entire mixture down firmly with your fingers.\nPlace pan into the oven and cook for 25 minutes or until edges are golden brown. If you are using an 11x13 pan, it will take a bit less time because the mixture will be much thinner.\nLet cool for 10 minutes before slicing into strips. Let the remaining bars cool entirely before you place in tupperware or wrap them in foil.",

Add the garlic, 2 ice cubes and the rest of the ingredients, pounding quickly to make a paste.You want to leave a bit of a texture for crunch.\nCook the pasta al dente, as per directions, drain and reserve some of the boiling water. Toss the pasta with the pesto, using some of the reserved water to make it creamier. Grate some fresh pecorino or ricotta salata (or both) over and serve hot with a leaf of basil to garnish.",

Pour heaping 1/4 cup batter onto griddle and spread to make about 4-inch pancake. Drop about 10 blueberries onto each pancake. Cook 3 minutes, or until edges are dry and bottom is golden. Flip pancake and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer or until lightly golden on both sides. Adjust heat as needed to prevent burning. Place pancakes on a heatproof platter and keep warm in oven.

        "Season the chops with salt and pepper on both sides. Saut the pork chops in hot oil for 5 minutes on each side until browned. Transfer the chops to a warm plate.\nSwirl the butter into the pan, and add the onion and apples. Saut until the onion slices are lightly caramelized and the apples have begun to soften, about 8 minutes.\nStir in the wine or other liquid. Return chops to the pan.\nCook until the pork is tender, about 15 more minutes (depending on the size of the chops), turning halfway through and covering the chops with the apple mixture.\nServe the chops over rice or mashed potatoes with a large spoonful of the apple-onion mixture over the top.\nEasy suggestion: replace the onion with leeks or add a sliced potato. You can deglaze the pan with beer, cider, chicken broth, or even water.",

        "<ol><li>To prep the burgers:  In a medium bowl, toss in the ground meat, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and Worcestershire sauce.</li><li>Mix together with a fork.</li><li>Once the ingredients have been combined, form four patties.</li><li>To prep the red onion:  Brush olive oil on both sides of all the slices and then sprinkle with some salt and pepper.</li><li>For the lemon garlic aioli:  In a small bowl, mix all the ingredients together.</li><li>Place back in refrigerator until burgers are cooked.</li><li>To cook:  Preheat grill to around 350.</li><li>If using cast iron grates, use a paper towel or cloth to wipe all grates with canola oil.</li><li>Place burger patties on grill.</li><li>Close lid and prep the buns by brushing canola oil on insides.</li><li>After a few minutes, check the patties.  If the bottom half looks just about cooked, roughly 3 minutes, flip over, and place cheese on top.</li><li>Add red onions and buns (cut side down).</li><li>Close lid.  After another 3 or so minutes, remove everything from grill.  The cheese wont be completely melted, because of the thickness, but its okay, thats the point ;-)  The cheese will stay extra sharp if the inside isnt melted.  On the red onions, youre looking for good char marks on one side, but the onion still a bit crunchy.  For the buns, youre looking to get the bottoms nice and charred, but not so much as to make the bread tough.</li><li>To assemble the burger:  Place a handful of arugula leaves on the bottom slice of the bun.</li><li>Place burger with cheese slice on top.</li><li>Add the grilled red onions.</li><li>Slather the aioli liberally on the top half of the bun.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Mix the warm (not hot) water with the oil, honey and yeast. Allow it to foam for 10 minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients for the dough. Mix and then knead them, using a mixer with a bread hook, or by hand, until you have a soft, smooth and elastic dough (about 8-10 minutes).</li><li>Put the dough in a oiled bowl and let it rise, covered, for 2 hours or until it's puffy and nearly doubled in size</li><li>Lightly grease/butter a 9inch round cake pan that's at least 2inch deep (or grease a 9inch or 10inch springform pan).</li><li>Toss the apple chunks with the sugar, cinnamon and rum.</li><li>Gently deflate the dough, transfer it to a lightly greased work surface, and flatte n it into a rough rectangle, about 8 x 10 inches.</li><li>Spread half the apple chunks in the center of the dough (see remarks for details).</li><li>Fold a short edge of the dough over the apple in order to cover it, patting firmly to seal the apples and spread the dough a bit.</li><li>Spread the remaining apple atop the folded-over dough.</li><li>Cover the apples with the other side of the dough, again patting firmly (Basically, you've folded the dough like a letter, enclosing the apples inside.).</li><li>Take a long knife and cut the apple-filled dough into 16 pieces. Cut in half, then each half in halves, etc ... (This will be very, VERY messy; the dough is slippery, apples will fall out, sugar syrup will ooze... it's not pretty. Don't worry, and don't stress about making all the pieces the same size).</li><li>Lay the dough chunks into the pan (Crowd them so that they all fit in a single tight layer - barely. Lots of apple chunks will fall out during this process; just tuck them in among the dough pieces, or simply spread them on top.).</li><li>Cover the challah gently with lightly greased plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise for about 1- 1 1/2 hours, until it's a generous 2inches high (It should just crest the rim of a 9inch round cake pan). Twenty minutes before the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 325 F.</li><li>Place the bread in the lower third of the oven. Bake it for 55 minutes, or until the top is at least light golden brown all over and has no white spots.</li><li>Remove the challah from the oven, and after 5 minutes loosen the edges and carefully transfer it to a rack.</li><li>Let cool completely. Then whisk together the cider and powdered sugar and brush it over the top--allowing it to drizzle down the sides.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "Season both sides of the corned beef liberally with pepper. The corning of the beef makes the beef salty enough, so no need to add more.\nHeat 1 TBSP oil in a large, shallow oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and sear each side for about 3 minutes, just to develop a nice brown crust. This will seal in the beef's juices.\nRemove beef to a plate. Pour guinness into the pot to deglaze. Scrape up any browned bits. Add beef broth, pickling spice, brown sugar, bay leaf, and minced garlic. Bring mixture up to a simmer.\nReturn the beef to the pot with any additional juices that have accumulated on the plate.\nCover the pot and place on the bottom rack in your oven. Bake for 2 1/2 - 3 hours, or until a fork can easily be inserted into the meat.\nBaste the meat with the surrounding juices every 30 minutes or so.\nAfter 2 hours, add carrots, parsnips, and potatoes to the pot. They will only take about 25-30 minutes of simmering to cook.\nRemove pot from the oven. Place beef on a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving into thin slices (cut against the grain of the meat). Remove vegetables and arrange them on a serving platter. Cover with foil. Place the pot on the burner and bring sauce to a boil. Add cabbage and cook for about 7 minutes, until it has softened. Place the cabbage on the serving platter with the other vegetables.\nStrain the sauce in the pot and stir in 2 or 3 TBSP of spicy honey mustard until dissolved. Place in a small dish or gravy boat with a ladle and serve alongside the beef.\nAfter slicing the beef and arranging it on the serving platter, ladle the guinness mustard sauce over the top to rehydrate and glaze the beef and vegetables.",

      instructions:
        "Begin by pouring 4 C of whole milk into a large cooking pot. Add 1 C of sugar. Add 1 C of vegetable oil. Heat it over a medium flame and stir till sugar has dissolved. Do NOT boil.\nSet the mixture aside to cool till lukewarm. About 38 deg C. Check with your finger right into the mixture. If its hot, then cool some more. I should be just very mildly comfortably warm to the touch.\nWhen the mixture is lukewarm, add 2 packets of instant dry yeast (about 16g, 4.5 teaspoons). Sprinkle the yeast on the surface of the mixture. Leave it for 3 to 5 minutes. If the yeast is fresh and alive, you will see it growing and poofing up.\nAdd 8 C of plain flour. Mix it all up together. Dont overmix.\nCover with a table cloth and set aside covered in a warm place for 1 hour.\nAfter an hour, the dough would have risen to twice its size. Punch the dough down. Add the last C of flour.\nAdd 1 heaping teaspoon of baking powder.\nAdd 1 scant teaspoon of baking soda.\nAdd 2 teaspoons of salt.\nMix it up. Cover the dough again. And this time, either leave it in a warm place again for 1 hour. Or leave it covered in the fridge for 3 hours to rise slowly.\nNote: I left it in the fridge for 3 hours. The dough may be easier to manage when left to rise this way instead as it will be colder and harder.\nAfter the mentioned time, the dough would have risen again. Punch it down.\nKnead the dough for a few moments and then transfer the dough to the working table that has been lightly floured.\nIf the dough is too wet at this stage. Chill it in the fridge for a while. Itll help.\nFlour a rolling pin. And roll out the dough into a huge long rectangle.\nCut the dough into 2 parts. So that there are two long pieces of dough.\nPour 2 cups of melted butter onto the rolled out dough.\nNote: Check your dough. If its VERY wet, reduce the amount of melted butter added at this stage. When the rolls are laid out in the pan later, pour the rest of the melted butter on them instead. I really prefer to add all the melted butter at this stage because the flavour goes right into the dough.\nUsing fingers, evenly distribute the butter.\nSprinkle 1/4 cup of cinnamon over the dough.\nSprinkle 1 cup of castor sugar over the dough.\nSprinkle 1 cup of brown sugar over the dough. As brown sugar gets clumpy. I scattered the sugar on the dough with my fingers.\nChop some pecan nuts to get about 2 cups worth of chopped pecans.\nSprinkle the chopped pecan nuts onto the rolled dough.\nRoll up the dough, lengthwise. It will be a really long roll. If the dough is very wet and you are struggling to roll it, add some flour to the surfaces to help you roll.\nCut into 1 inch thick rolls.\nRub pans or baking dishes generously with more melted butter. Place the cinnamon rolls comfortably in each pan/dish. Do not overcrowd as they will expand alot in the pan. Pour remaining butter over the rolls. Dont be afraid!\nSet them aside for 1 hour. If theres wind/draft in your kitchen, cover the rolls with table cloths. The rolls will rise some more.\nPop the rolls into a oven, preheated at 180 deg Celsius. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes.\nWhile the rolls are baking, make the icing. Dont get stressed about the proportions. Just mix the ingredients till you get a gooey consistency to pour over like syrup.\nMake a 1/4 cup of strong coffee with 1/4 cup water and one 3-in-1 coffee mix.\nAdd 1 tablespoon of the best honey you can get your hands on. Maple syrup works too.\nStir the honey into the coffee.\nAdd a pinch of salt.\nAdd 6 tablespoons of melted butter.\nAdd 2 cups of icing sugar.\nWhisk it all up.\nAdd 1 to 2 tablespoons of fresh cream.\nStir in the cream.\nPour the icing over the rolls while they are still hot.",

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Preheat the oven to 360 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><li>To make the caramel, heat together the water and sugar gently over a medium flame for about 10 minutes, ensuring the mixture does not burn.</li><li>Meanwhile, pour the condensed milk and whole milk into a pan. Add the zest of the limes. Slice the vanilla pod in half and carefully scrape out the vanilla seeds and add these to your milk mixture.</li><li>Simmer the milk slowly for fifteen minutes to let the flavours infuse.</li><li>Once the caramel is ready, pour into a cake pan and swirl it around to evenly coat the bottom of the pan. Set aside.</li><li>In a bowl, crack the eggs and beat together. Slowly pour a little of the warm milk , vanilla and lime mixture into the eggs. This will temper the eggs and prevent them from scrambling from the heat. Once the temperature of the eggs has been raised by the warm milk, pour in the rest of the milk. Pour all of the mixture into the cake pan over the caramel.</li><li>Cook the cake pan in a water bath by placing the pan inside a larger pan which is filled half way with water. Place in the oven and cook for 45 minutes to an hour.</li><li>Once ready, allow to cool and place inside a fridge overnight. The flan is then ready to be flipped over gently and served.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "1.Preheat the oven to 375F. Break the capellini into approximately 3-inch lengths. Spread the pasta on a baking sheet, slide it into the oven, and toast, tossing occasionally with tongs, until golden brown, about 12 minutes.\n2.Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large pot (at least 5 1/2 quarts) with a lid over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt and cook, allowing them only to soften and grow aromatic but not brown, about 5 minutes. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the zucchini and another pinch of salt. Saut until the zucchini is well browned, about 5 more minutes.\n3.Place the noodles on top of the zucchini mixture. Layer the asparagus and 1 cup of the cherry tomatoes on top of that and sprinkle in the smoked paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, oregano, and rosemary. Pour the red wine and  cup of water over the top. Toss as best you can with tongs; it will be hard at first because the noodles are stiff. Return the heat to medium and cover the pot.\n4.Every 3 minutes, remove the lid and toss the pasta. The total cooking time will be 8 to 12 minutes. Toward the end, taste a noodle each time you remove the lid to see if it is done. If not, and there isnt any moisture left on the bottom of the pot, add a bit more wine or water, about 1/3 cup.\n5.When the noodles are done to your liking, taste and make any final adjustments to the seasoning. Transfer to serving bowls. Garnish with the remaining 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, the parsley, and another grind of black pepper. Serve immediately.",

Blend for about a minute or until completely smooth. This amount of time will depend on how powerful your blender is. It may take longer (or shorter!).\n\nAdd more liquid as needed. This will also depend on how much water your fruit releases. If it’s too thick, add more almond milk or limeade until the smoothie reaches your desired consistency.\n\nServe the smoothies immediately or pour into an airtight, freezer-safe container and freeze for up to 2 months. Defrost in the refrigerator for 24 hours before serving.",

      instructions:
        "First off, mix the flours together and whisk so they are combined well.\nThis recipe requires you to make a sponge. For this you take 1/2 cup of flour and place in a large bowl with the half cup warm water and the yeast. Cover the bowl with plastic and let stand anywhere from 2-8 hours. This is to allow it to ferment, I personally couldn't wait the whole time, I think I made it a minute past the 2 hour mark.\nStir in the 1 cup of water a little at a time. Add in the salt and just enough of the flour to make the dough pull away from the sides of the bowl.\nTurn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead enough flour to make a soft dough. It should be smooth and elastic. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat the dough ball lightly, and cover. Place in a warm place where a draft cannot get to it and allow to rise about 1 hour.\nPrep a large baking pan (pizza pan works well) by either taking an oiled napkin and running it around the pan or line with parchment paper.\nPunch the dough down and allow to rest 10 minutes.\nOil your hands and place dough in the pan. Brush the top of the dough with oil then, using your fingers, make deep dimples in the dough, about 1/2 inch. Cover with plastic again and let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 400F(200C).\nTake the olives, feta and basil and spread on top of the foccacia. Sprinkle salt on top and place in oven. Bake 18 - 20 minutes  or until golden. Check about half way through and deflate any large bubbles with the poke of a knife.\nWhen done cooking, place on a rack to cool for about 15 - 20 minutes.\nThis bread is very versatile. You can make it into small mini loaves (as in the original recipe) or in a big one like I did. You can also top it with a number of different ingredients, just let your craving drive you :D!",

      instructions:
        "Pre-heat the oven to 180 C/355 F. Grease a 25 cm/9 inch cake tin and line the bottom with a round of baking paper. Wash the rhubarb stalks, cut into 1 inch lengths and while still slightly damp from washing, in a small bowl combine with the 2tsp of extra castor sugar to coat and set aside.\nBeat the eggs and sugar using either a hand-held electric beater or a stand-up mixer for 5 minutes until very thick and pale in colour. Slowly beat in the soft butter, then beat for a further few minutes. A few small lumps of butter will remain, this is okay. Gently fold in the almond meal, rice flour, baking powder and lemon zest. Spoon the mixture into the cake tin. Dot the rhubarb pieces on top, gently pushing them down into the batter a little. Bake for 35-40 minutes until a skewer pushed into the centre of the cake comes out clean and the rhubarb is tender.\nCool in the tin before serving dusted with icing sugar and softly whipped cream on the side. Enjoy!",

        "<ol><li>Begin by preheating the oven to 120C. An efficient oven is important for this dish. If the oven is too cold, the fish will not get cooked. If the oven tends to get too hot, the fish will be roasted and overcooked. If you are uncertain, then think about whether your cookies/cakes are usually overdone or underdone when you follow a recipe exactly. If they are always overdone, then you can turn down the temperature to 110C.</li><li>Get the freshest salmon fillets you can get your hands on. The thick ones are the nicest for this dish.</li><li>Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to the salmon fillets and rub it all over the fish.</li><li>Season generously with salt and pepper. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I usually use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper for each time that I need salt and pepper. Rub the seasonings all over the fish.</li><li>Slice two lemons into thick slices, discarding the ends. Lay the slices of lemons on a baking tray lined with baking paper.</li><li>Place the salmon fillets on top of the lemon slices. If you have left the skin on for the fillets, then make sure its skin side down.</li><li>Place the salmon fillets in the oven and cook for 25 mins. If the salmon fillets are very thick, cook a little longer for another 3 to 5 mins.</li><li>While the fish is cooking, prepare the vegetable medley and sauce.</li><li>Peel a large carrot and diagonally slice into thin slices.</li><li>Wash and pluck the leaves of a bunch of spinach. I used about 150g of baby spinach.</li><li>Heat a deep saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of cooking oil. Keep the heat at medium heat.</li><li>When the oil is hot, add 1 tablespoon of butter.</li><li>When the butter has melted, add the carrots and stir fry for a minute to cook and soften the carrots. I like them slightly crunchy so I dont cook them for too long here. Keep the heat at medium.</li><li>Remove the cooked carrot slices and set aside in a warm place.</li><li>In the same pan, add 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. Stir fry for 20 seconds.</li><li>Add the spinach leaves. Stir fry at medium heat.</li><li>Add salt and pepper to taste. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I used Masterfoods Garlic Pepper seasonings instead again.</li><li>Stir fry the spinach till its soft and wilted. Careful not to overcook as they would lose their natural pretty green colour.</li><li>Dish up the cooked spinach and set aside in a warm place.</li><li>Now make the sauce.</li><li>Peel off the hard outer layer of 2 stalks of lemon grass. Slice into 2 inch long pieces and using the back of your knife, bash the lemongrass and bruise the slightly for the fragrance and flavours to emit.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of butter to a small saucepan.</li><li>When the butter has melted and is bubbling slightly, add the lemongrass. Cook at medium heat for 30 seconds.</li><li>Add 150ml of fresh liquid cream. Let the mixture come to a gentle rolling boil.</li><li>Add 1 teaspoon of liquid chicken stock concentrate. Or you can use 1/2 cube of chicken stock bouillon. Stir it in well, and do a taste check. If its not salty enough, add more chicken stock.</li><li>Whisk the sauce as it boils and thickens.</li><li>After a couple of minutes, the sauce would have thickened. Remove the lemongrass.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I usually use a strainer and squeeze a lemon directly over the sauce. Do a taste check. Add more lemon juice if necessary. Whisk well to combine.</li><li>The salmon should be done by now. Remove them from the oven.</li><li>Plate your dish but placing some spinach and carrots at the bottom of a plate or shallow dish.</li><li>Gently place the salmon fillet on top. Drizzle a generous amount of sauce around the fish. Garnish with chives.</li></ol>",

        "<ol><li>1) Stir the flour, sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl until mixed.</li><li>In another bowl, beat the milk, melted butter, egg, vanilla, and food coloring until blended. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and beat until just blended (it's better to leave a few lumps than to overmix and make tough hotcakes). The hotcakes will be lighter if you let this batter stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes, or refrigerate it up to 1 day.</li><li>2) Heat a griddle or large heavy pan (cast iron is perfect) over medium heat. The griddle is hot enough when a drop of water skitters quickly across the surface. Brush the griddle with a little melted butter. Pour about 1/3 cup of batter for each hotcake, leaving a little space between the hotcakes to make it easy to turn them. Cook them until golden brown underneath (lift a corner to peek) and bubbles start to pop on the topsides. Flip the hotcakes carefully and cook them until the undersides are golden brown. Repeat with the rest of the batter. Serve hot with butter and maple syrup.</li></ol>",
